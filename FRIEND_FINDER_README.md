## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

The backend already includes all necessary endpoints:
- `GET /api/users/search` - Search for users
- `POST /api/users/friends/request` - Send friend request
- `PUT /api/users/friends/respond` - Accept/reject friend request
- `GET /api/users/friends` - Get friends list
- `GET /api/users/friends/pending` - Get pending requests
- `DELETE /api/users/friends/:friendId` - Remove friend

### 2. Database Setup

The database tables are automatically created when the server starts:
- `users` - User profiles and information
- `friends` - Friend relationships and requests
- `notifications` - Friend request notifications

### 3. Seed Sample Data

To test the feature with sample users, run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This will create 10 sample users with credentials:
- **Email**: john.doe@university.edu
- **Password**: password123
